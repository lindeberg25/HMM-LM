# NLP-sequencial-data

This project aims to apply Text Segmentation techniques using Transformer archquitecture in epitope prediction task. This is a cooperation between UNB Vision group and Aston University epitope prediction group

All the experiments will be included in the Lindeberg's thesis

This repository has the follow experiments:

1 - epitope_prediction_elmo_plus_linear_models

2 - epitope_prediction_elmo_dense_layers

3 - epitope_prediction_optimized_bert_uncased

4 - epitope_prediction_optimized_roberta_uncased

5 - epitope_prediction_optimized_xlnet_cased

6 - epitope_prediction_optimized_protbert_uncased

7 - epitope_prediction_bert_extended
