# NLP-sequencial-data

This project aims to apply Text Segmentation techniques based on Transformer architecture in the epitope prediction task. This is a cooperation between the UNB Vision group and the Aston University epitope prediction group

This repository has the following experiments:

1 - epitope_prediction_elmo_plus_linear_models

2 - epitope_prediction_elmo_dense_layers

3 - epitope_prediction_optimized_bert_uncased

4 - epitope_prediction_optimized_roberta_uncased

5 - epitope_prediction_optimized_xlnet_cased

6 - epitope_prediction_optimized_protbert_uncased

7 - epitope_prediction_bert_extended

8 - epitope_prediction_retrained_bert


All these experiments will be included in Lindeberg's thesis
