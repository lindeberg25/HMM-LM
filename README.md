# Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Language Modeling (LM)

This project aims to HMM and LM in the epitope prediction task. This is a cooperation between the UNB Vision group and the Aston University epitope prediction group

This repository has the following experiments:

1 - refine-epitope-hmm-2-hidden-states

2 - refine-epitope-hmm-positive-negative

3 - refine-epitope-hmm-16-hidden-states

4 - epitope_prediction_elmo_plus_linear_models

5 - epitope_prediction_elmo_dense_layers

6 - epitope_prediction_optimized_bert_uncased

7 - epitope_prediction_optimized_roberta_uncased

8 - epitope_prediction_optimized_xlnet_cased

9 - epitope_prediction_optimized_protbert_uncased

10 - epitope_prediction_bert_extended

11 - epitope_prediction_retrained_bert


All these experiments will be included in Lindeberg's thesis
